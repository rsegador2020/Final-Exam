                <div class="title sm-bg-grey md-bg-red lg-bg-orange"> John Espanol and Angelica Alentijo </div>
                <p>
                    Because of his shyness, John has never expressed his true feelings for Angelica. Though its pretty obvious, Angelica also has something that she feels for John.
                  
                  We'll never know on who might try to make the first move.

                <div class="title sm-bg-grey md-bg-green lg-bg-pink">Glenn and Lizethe </div>
                <p>
                    Our classmates observed that these two get along very well, and it might even lead to a relationship sooner or later. Glenn is very clingy, while Lizethe is sweet. A perfect combo.

                <div class="title sm-bg-grey md-bg-yellow lg-bg-purple">Abe and Leslie</div>
                <p >
                  These two are the most controversial of all, Abe claims that he's just messing around when he says that he has feelings for Leslie. Well for us, his classmate doesn't think that he's just messing with us. We think that inorder to confess his feeling, he started it as a joke. But in reality, what he said was actually true.
